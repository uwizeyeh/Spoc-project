                1. What is Java technology and why do I need it?
                Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. <br>There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day. Java is fast, secure, and reliable.<br> From laptops to datacenters, game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere.

              2. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
              HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a text-based approach to describing how content contained within an HTML file is structured.<br> This markup tells a web browser how to display the text, images and other forms of multimedia on a webpage
            </p>

            <p>
              3. C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of the C language.<br> It is therefore possible to code C++ in a "C style" or "object-oriented style." In certain scenarios, it can be coded in either way and is thus an effective example of a hybrid language.
